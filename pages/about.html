          <h3>General Information</h3>
          <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in Chicago's
          northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be
          between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood. NYSL is ran by a small full-time
